Description: Implements modular Bayesian inference for linear regression when
    some predictors are themselves outputs of an earlier Bayesian analysis.
    Instead of plugging in point estimates, this approach borrows posterior
    samples of the predictors and, for each such sample, fits the current
    response model by sampling the regression coefficients from the conditional
    posterior distribution. This ensures proper propagation of uncertainty from
    the previous analysis to the current one, while avoiding unwanted feedback
    between the two models. The method can be viewed as a cut model (Plummer,
    2014 <doi:10.1007/s11222-014-9503-z>), which severs feedback in the
    underlying graphical model. Such modular strategies are useful for post-hoc
    analyses or combining evidence from multiple data sources; see Bayarri et
    al. (2009) <doi:10.1214/09-BA404> and Jacob et al. (2017)
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1708.08719>.
